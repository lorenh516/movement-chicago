## Chicago Movement Study

### Goal
Compare geographic and income mobility for Chicagoans between the two 5-year American Community Survey periods during (2008-2012) and immediately after the Great Recession (2013-2017) to assess trends across racial populations in Chicago, arguably one of the most segregated cities in the US.

### Methods
I utilized `D3.js` and `Leaflet` to create an interactive visualization of geographic and income mobility for Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White populations in Chicago between 2008-2012, and 2013-2017.

View the visualization on my [Chicago Movement Study](https://lorenh516.github.io/movement-chicago/) page.
